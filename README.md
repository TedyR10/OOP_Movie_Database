# POOTV Part 1

### Description:

* This project focuses on developing a Netflix-like app in Java
* The user can perform several actions, from changing pages & filtering movies
  to purchasing, watching and even rating movies.
***

### Design patterns & program structure
* I designed everything to be easily changed and upgraded for part 2 of the project.
* For both databases I am using the singleton design pattern due to their only instantiation
being when the program is started. We don't need more instances of the databases as we are
clearing them after each test.
* For the pages I am using the visitor design pattern, as I find it really useful in this case, 
  making the creation of other pages later on really easy.
* For the output I am using the factory design pattern, because I need specific outputs for 
  different scenarios.
* For filtering movies I am using the strategy design pattern, because we don't always have to 
  sort by the same criteria.
* Packages are named and organized based on the purpose they serve in our program.
***

### How the program works
* We start by reading the input from a file & entering both the users and movies into our
databases. After that, we initialize the current session & start iterating through the actions.
* Actions are then received sequentially and are handled by the ActionHandler class. We can 
  either change pages or do page-specific actions.
* Then, every action ends up in the PageVisitor class where the visitors are implemented. 
  This class does most of the heavy lifting, as here we have most of our methods.
* From here, every visit method does specific things, from purchasing a movie to filtering the 
  available movies by a genre.
***

### Class comments (*Only worth mentioning)

#### OutputGenerator
* Outputs are generated by factory based on different circumstances and are displayed
  after an error or successful attempts at logging in, registering, changing page to "movies",
  seeing details about a movie, purchasing, watching, liking or rating a movie or when
  searching/filtering movies.
***

#### Session
* In this class I store info about the current session: if there is anyone logged in, which user 
  is logged in, their current movies list (different from their available movies list if we 
  apply filter/search/sort) & the current movie for see details action

***

#### Filters
* Filtering movies can be done by actors or genres and movies can also be sorted either by rating or
  duration.
* Here, I check what actions I need to perform and make use of the strategy design pattern by 
  calling the FiltersContext class to execute the right strategy.

***

#### PageVisitor
* PageVisitor is the class where most of the methods for visit are implemented and mainly checks 
  for the right circumstances, then calls the appropriate method for the action given.

***

### Comments:
* For part 2 I was thinking of implementing a Builder-Strategy abstract Page class to better 
  link the pages to one another so that when you want to change page, you don't have to 
  always check if the given page is available or not, like I do in this implementation, you 
  would have a list of available pages and a function to immediately check if the action is right.
* This can also be used for users/movies if the fields given as input can also be optional, not 
  only mandatory.
* Given my astounding performance for the last homework (most lines written in main xD), I 
  thought that this time I might want to get the prize for the most organized homework. Let me 
  know your thoughts and what I can improve upon :)
